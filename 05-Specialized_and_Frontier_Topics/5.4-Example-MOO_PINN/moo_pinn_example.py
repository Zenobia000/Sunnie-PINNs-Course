This script is a CONCEPTUAL SKELETON and is NOT MEANT TO BE RUNNABLE.

It illustrates the algorithmic logic of a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)
approach for training a PINN, specifically using the GradNorm algorithm.

Implementing this requires a custom training loop, which is different from the
standard `model.train()` approach in DeepXDE. This pseudo-code is written
in a PyTorch-style for clarity.

Problem: 1D Poisson Equation
- PDE: -u_xx = pi^2 * sin(pi*x)
- BC: u(-1) = 0, u(1) = 0
