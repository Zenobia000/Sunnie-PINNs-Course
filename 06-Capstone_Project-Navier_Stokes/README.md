# Part 6: Capstone Project - Navier-Stokes Equations (Knowledge Area)

## 1. Introduction to the Capstone Project

Welcome to the capstone project for this course. This module serves as a synthesis of all the concepts we have covered, from the fundamentals of PINNs to advanced problem formulations. We will tackle one of the most significant and challenging sets of equations in all of physics and engineering: the **Navier-Stokes equations** for incompressible fluid flow.

Solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a classic benchmark for numerical methods and represents a significant achievement for any computational framework. By solving it with a PINN, you will demonstrate a comprehensive mastery of the techniques learned throughout this course.

## 2. The Physics and Mathematics (First Principles)

The Navier-Stokes equations are an expression of **Newton's second law (conservation of momentum)** as applied to a fluid element. For an incompressible, Newtonian fluid, the steady-state equations in two dimensions are a system of coupled, nonlinear PDEs:

1.  **Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)**: This equation enforces the incompressibility constraint.
    \[
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0
    \]
2.  **Conservation of Momentum (x-direction)**:
    \[
    u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)
    \]
3.  **Conservation of Momentum (y-direction)**:
    \[
    u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right)
    \]

Here:
-   \( u(x, y) \) is the fluid velocity in the x-direction.
-   \( v(x, y) \) is the fluid velocity in the y-direction.
-   \( p(x, y) \) is the pressure field.
-   \( \rho \) is the fluid density (constant).
-   \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity.

The challenges in solving this system are numerous: it is a **coupled system** of three equations, it is **nonlinear** due to the convective acceleration terms (e.g., \( u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \)), and the pressure \( p \) acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the incompressibility constraint, which can make the problem numerically stiff.

## 3. The Benchmark Problem: 2D Lid-Driven Cavity Flow (BoK)

To test our PINN model, we will solve a classic benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD): the **2D Lid-Driven Cavity Flow**.

-   **Setup**: A square cavity is filled with a fluid. The bottom and side walls are stationary (no-slip condition: \( u=0, v=0 \)). The top wall (the "lid") moves with a constant horizontal velocity (e.g., \( u=1, v=0 \)).
-   **Phenomenon**: The moving lid drags the fluid at the top, creating a large primary vortex in the center of the cavity. Depending on the Reynolds number (\( Re = \frac{UL}{\nu} \)), smaller, secondary vortices may appear in the corners.
-   **Goal**: Our PINN must learn the velocity fields (\( u, v \)) and the pressure field (\( p \)) that satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations and the boundary conditions for this setup.

## 4. Next Steps

We will now proceed to the implementation submodule, `6.1-2D_Lid_Driven_Cavity_Flow`, where we will use `DeepXDE` to construct a PINN to solve this challenging and rewarding problem.
